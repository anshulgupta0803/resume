\cvevent{}{Scalability, Reliability, and Security of BodhiTree}{Jul '18 -- Present}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{OBJECTIVE} --- Supporting no more than 250 students combined with the security bugs, BodhiTree needs to be revamped, so that theoretically, its performance can increase linearly with linear increase in resources
	%\item BodhiTree - an initiative for e-learning by IIT Bombay mimics a classroom setting, providing flexibility for students to study at their own pace
	\item Expected outcome from this project is a scalable LMS which can be distributed (as an application container) and deployed with ease

\cvevent{}{Modeling Virtualized Applications using Machine Learning Techniques}{Spring 2017}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Performance models allows administrators to explore "what-if?" scenarios without the need of actual hardware. Simulations can be performed to get the expected performance if the model is correct
	\item Surveyed various machine learning approaches like ANNs/SVMs, Kalman Filters, Markov Models and Self-Organizing Maps for building performance models of virtualized applications

\cvevent{}{ASSR: Automatic Stuttered Speech Recognition}{Autumn '17}{}{\faGit\hspace{0.5em}\href{https://github.com/anshulgupta0803/ASSR}{\faExternalLink}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{OBJECTIVE} --- Enabling people having a stuttering speech impediment to use the current state-of-the-art speech-to-text systems
	\item UCLASS database was used for training and testing the ANN. IBM Watson's Speech-to-text system was used for validation of the corrected audio
%	\item Stuttered audio is segmented with the duration on 300ms and an overlap of 200ms which allowed the model to detect stutter at a granularity of 100ms

	\item \textbf{OBJECTIVE} --- Draw bounding box on all the faces in an image
	\item Developed a Faster-RCNN based model using VGG16 transfer learning
	\item Training dataset (WIDER): 12K 600x600 images. Test dataset (FDDB): 2845 images with 5171 faces. The accuracy obtained was 87\%
